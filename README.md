## Program Description:
this program reads in a file name from the user and then writes to the file the full value calculated for Pi using the Spigot algorithm.

## How to run the Fortran program:
- cd into the folder containing the "spigot.f95" file 
- type 'gfortran - Wall spigot.f95' to compile
- to run the program type './a.out'

## How to run the Ada program:
- cd into the folder containing the "spigot.adb" file 
- type 'gnatmake - Wall spigot.adb' to compile
- to run the program type './spigot'

## How to run the C program:
- cd into the folder containing the "spigot.c" file 
- type 'gcc -Wall spigot.c' to compile
- to run the program type './a.out'

## How to run the Python program:
- cd into the folder containing the "spigot.py" file 
- type 'python spigot.py' to compile and run the program

## TO NOTE: 
Make sure to delete executables and output files after running each
program, as to not get confused by which program created each (will overwrite them
if they are not deleted)

## Assumptions:
The file name given will be a valid one (correct file extensions).

## Additional Information:
Assignment for CIS*3190 in 2019.
